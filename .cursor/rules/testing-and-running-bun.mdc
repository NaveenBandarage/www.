# Development Workflow with Bun

## Package Manager

- This project uses **Bun** as the package manager and runtime, NOT npm or yarn
- Always use `bun` commands instead of `npm` or `yarn`
- Install dependencies with: `bun install`

## Development Commands

### Before Starting Development

Always run a build first to ensure linting and type checking:

```bash
bun run build
```

This will:

- Run TypeScript type checking
- Run ESLint to catch any linting errors
- Generate the production build
- Execute the postbuild script (sitemap generation)
- Ensure all code is valid before starting the dev server

### Starting the Development Server

After a successful build, start the dev server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

### Complete Workflow

For the most thorough validation:

```bash
bun run build && bun run dev
```

## Other Available Commands

- `bun run lint` - Run ESLint only
- `bun run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `bun run start` - Start production server
- `bun run export` - Build and export static site

## Best Practices

- Always run `bun run build` before committing changes to catch errors early
- If the build fails, fix all errors before proceeding with development
- The build command will catch TypeScript errors, linting issues, and build problems
- Ensure the dev server runs without errors or warnings
