It's been a while, I said I was going to blog more and unfortunately I haven't. I've been busy with work, life and other things. I've also been trying to get back into the habit of writing. I've been writing a lot of code, but not a lot of words.

This will be a sitrep on my goals for 2025.

1. Move to NYC and get a software eng job there. - I have basically accomplished this. From August I'll be living and working from NYC.
2. [Redacted health-related] - _will unredact if I accomplish it_ - I am basically not on target for this because of goal #1 I decided to focus fully on that and I've ended up neglecting this I'll try and get this sorted for the next 6 months.
3. Cut down on spending and focus on underconsumption. Build savings and increase my investments hit [Redacted target numbers]. - I'm doing well on this front and I think I should be able to hit my target numbers.
4. Make meditation a daily habit. - I'm so so on this hasn't become a daily habit but I am definitely more mindful and better because of this.
5. Run a half marathon (or marathon if I'm able to do a half decently). - Zero progress on this.
6. [Redacted personal related] - _will unredact if I accomplish it_ - There is some progress on this but not much lol.
7. Get to 1000 subscribers on YouTube, and build a TikTok following. - No motion on TikTok but I've been posting to YouTube and I've been getting some views, haven't posted in a while but at time of writing 216 subscribers.
8. Keep a regular habit of journaling either via computer-based apps or ideally offline with pen and paper. - I've been journaling but not as regularly as I'd like.
9. Keep in touch with friends and family, and foster new relationships. - I've definitely been doing this well.
10. Be more open, smile more, talk to random people and give more compliments. - Yep I've been doing this.

But yeah overall I'd rate myself pretty decently on how I'm tracking. I set some pretty ambitious and far ranging goals and for the most part I'm doing good so far. But again a lot can change in the coming months and I can definitely do a lot more. I'm in the process of writing a blog for work that I will eventually change up slightly and repost here. So stay tuned.
