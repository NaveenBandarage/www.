It's scary and I'm not used to doing it but I'm going to put my goals out there into the ether that is the internet. Let's see what happens. Some of them are too personal, and I don't feel comfortable putting them out there just yet, so I've redacted them.

I'm not the biggest fan of setting goals for the entirety of the year and working towards them. One because a year is so far away and things change, two I tend to forget them, and three because I find it easier to work in a kanban style approach. By that, I mean I pull in goals and work on them in shorter periods. So this list will ebb and flow as the year goes on. But here goes:

1. [Redacted career-related] - _will unredact if I accomplish it_
2. [Redacted health-related] - _will unredact if I accomplish it_
3. Cut down on useless spending and keep my investments and savings growing. I have specific numbers I want to hit but will keep them on the down low.
4. Have more consistent wake-up and bedtimes. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep.
5. Stop using devices, be it my phone or computer, in bed.
6. Get my RHR (resting heart rate) to 55.
7. [Redacted personal related] - _will unredact if I accomplish it_
8. Get back to uploading YouTube videos after completing [Redacted career goal], and aim to get 1000 subscribers.
9. Keep a regular habit of journaling either via computer-based apps or ideally offline with pen and paper.
10. Make meditating a habit.
11. Add to my tech repertoire (how to define this I have no idea but we shall see).
12. Travel to more places and try different things.
13. Say yes to more stuff (within reason).

If you have any goals that you're working towards, please let me know. I love to hear about what people are working on and thinking about doing.
