Last year I put my goals on the internet where any friend, foe and in between could discover. As scary as it was, nothing really happened negatively to me that stopped me from doing it again. So here we are.

These goals will be fluid. In a year a lot can happen and a lot will change, so I may add or remove from this list as time goes on.

1. Move to NYC and get a software eng job there.
2. [Redacted health-related] - _will unredact if I accomplish it_
3. Cut down on spending and focus on underconsumption. Build savings and increase my investments hit [Redacted target numbers].
4. Make meditation a daily habit.
5. Run a half marathon (or marathon if I'm able to do a half decently).
6. [Redacted personal related] - _will unredact if I accomplish it_
7. Get to 1000 subscribers on YouTube, and build a TikTok following.
8. Keep a regular habit of journaling either via computer-based apps or ideally offline with pen and paper.
9. Keep in touch with friends and family, and foster new relationships.
10. Be more open, smile more, talk to random people and give more complements.

If you have any goals that you're working towards, please let me know. I love to hear about what people are working on and thinking about doing.
