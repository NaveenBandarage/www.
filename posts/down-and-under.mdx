It's the end of April and I haven't wrote anything since January. So to ease myself into the habit of writing I'm going to share the podcasts that I've been enjoying.

## Podcasts

I've kinda leaned off listening to music. I still bump stuff when I'm at the gym or listen to mixes while I'm working. But generally speaking I don't listen to as much music as I used to. What's filled that void instead is Podcasts and a wide variety of them. So, in no particular order here are the podcasts that I've been listening to:

- [Flagrant (and the patreon)](https://www.youtube.com/@OfficialFlagrant)

- [Brilliant Idiots](https://www.youtube.com/@BrilliantIdiotsPod)

- [What Now with Trevor Noah](https://open.spotify.com/show/122imavATqSE7eCyXIcqZL?si=eeabae88a9f24487)

- [The Ringer MMA Show](https://open.spotify.com/show/6Hz0d62BaXRMih8RjZ5Hov?si=25312b86055845f7)

- [Nightcap](https://www.youtube.com/@NightcapShow_)

After reflecting seems like I'm listening to a lot of sports related podcasts haha. I'm always open to recommendations, so if you have some please do send them my way.

## Random:

Recently, I went back to the land of the free, the USA, with by my brother. The experience proved to be truly eye-opening in numerous ways. While I am American, my formative years and the person I've become were shaped outside its borders, so returning felt both oddly familiar and somewhat distant. Nonetheless, it was a journey I thoroughly enjoyed, and I plan to share more about it in a write-up soon.

Why I moved

What it feels like and thoughts so far

It's only been 3 or so weeks since I've moved. In that time, I feel like a lot has changed and a lot just feels different. Well duh, changing country
